# Sesars_project
This repository implements various robot localization methods, including Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Particle Filter, and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), using ROS2 and Python. Each algorithm is designed to work with simulated or real robotic systems, providing modular and well-documented code for easy integration into projects.
